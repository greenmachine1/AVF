            <p>The types of native features that can be implemented with HTML/CSS and JAVASCRIPT are Accelerometer, Camera, Compass, your contacts, Geolocation, media, networking, notifications and storage.  The types of native features I can see myself using with my app are Geolocation, Notifications, media, and contacts.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>The lessons learned while developing for an app is that you really need to understand the niche you are aiming for and also what is appeasing to you.  Coming from a personal standpoint, I am trying to build apps that I would like to use.  I have a need to connect with other musicians and book gigs outside my normal stomping grounds so Im developing an app that lets me do just that.  So you have to really understand your own needs as well as look at people around you who might also have a want for that as well.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>My app is going to be using Geolocation extensively.  Based on your current location, I plan on having it bring up local shows and bands so you can check them out pretty much where ever you happen to be.</p>
