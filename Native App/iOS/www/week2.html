            <h1>Week 2:Accessibility</h1>
            
            <p>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?  I was really barebones about my coding and html this time around.  I did not use any jquery as I stuck with just simple Javascript.  I almost prefer regular Javascript over jquery because it seems more logical to me.  I have to physically see me grabbing an ID tag or different elements rather than just relying on jquery to do its thing.  I used a lot of div tags in my main html and used a few class tags where I could have used ID tags.  So there is one spot in which I would have changed things.  Also, having descriptions for my video and photo elements would have been nice.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?  An issue that I can see right off the bat is that these screen reader programs will read just about everything on the screen when all you want is the main content.  I had enabled voiceover on my iPad once and found it incredibly difficult to turn off as my controls had changed from what I was used to.  Dragging with one finger would target an element and read it aloud instead of dragging the page.  So it made negotiating pages difficult.  Also, the digital voice sounds like certain words run together incoherently and is rather fast.  I would personally fix this issue by giving the user and option to slow down the text being read.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.  Well, the one im most familiar with is the iPad as it allows voice over.  My macbook pro also does this as well in a similar annoying fashion.  Siri for the iphone is a huge leap forward in this area though and I think this will be more accessible for hearing impaired users.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>I know of brail devices that are used in tandem with computers and other devices that let the user feel what is being shown on screen.  Also, word prediction software has advanced greatly in the past few years to help aid in the typing process on mobile and home computers.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.  Recapping on Siri for iOS; this is a great app for communicating with your phone without physical input.  I read about an app called Color namer which vocalizes the color of an object to a person who cant see.  It uses the camera of the phone and deciphers the actual color of the object.  Pretty neat!</p>
