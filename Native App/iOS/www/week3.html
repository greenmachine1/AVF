            <h1>Week 3:</h1>
            
            <p>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?The most widely used apps in the US are games, news apps, maps, social networking and music applications.</p>
            
            <p>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?
            It seems that Japan is all about the Augmented reality apps first and formost.  Next in line is gaming, then e-commerce apps.</p>
            
            <p>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?
            
            In the top selling apps in the UK, most seem to be leaning towards games then utility.Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?
                It seems that no matter where you go, people are into mobile gaming.</p>
            
            <p>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?
            Most people are using 2.3 it seems.   Over 60% are using this.</p>
            
            <p>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?
            
            In the US, the average price of data for 5gig and 10gig are around $50 to $80 on 4g LTE networks.  Pretty expensive if you ask me.  How will this impact development â€“ it will hinder streaming services quite a bit, making pieces of your application as native as possible is key here.</p>
            
            <p>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.
            
            I believe a good understanding of where things are headed will keep you level and not caught off guard.  I also think that you should be looking at what other countries are doing and possibly dive into their current positions for choosing an app.  For instance, diving into the Augmented reality sector for Japan would be an awesome thing to get into.</p>
